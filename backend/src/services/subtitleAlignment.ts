 * Sentence/word-timestamp alignment for the "Whisper 精準對齊" subtitle sync mode.

 * each sentence's playback time purely from character counts, scaled to the page's known audio
 * duration — it has no idea where the real pauses/emphasis actually land. This module instead
 * takes Whisper's word-level timestamps (transcribed from the *actual* synthesized audio) and
 * maps each sentence onto them by proportional character position, giving each sentence a real
 * start/end time grounded in what was actually spoken.

// removes the in-package drift risk between this module and textSentences.ts.
